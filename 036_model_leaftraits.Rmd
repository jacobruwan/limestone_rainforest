## Species Composition: Leaf Trait Analysis
In this analysis, the differences in leaf trait are investigated. 

```{r load_datasets}
dropbox <- "C:\\Users\\Jacob\\Dropbox\\Semester 2 2017\\MXB344\\Project\\Data\\"

load(paste0(dropbox, "biotic_leaftraits.RData"))

# Go through the variables and unselect predictor variable that don't make sense
# biotic_leaftraits.df %>% str()

leaf.df <- biotic_leaftraits.df

# Look at structure of modelling df
# sla.df %>% str()
```

### Bayesian Mutlimonial
```{r}



```

### Frequentist Multinomial
```{r}
library(nnet)

fit.lfmulti <- multinom(leaf_arrangement ~ site + av_trans_elevation,
                        data = leaf.df)



```
